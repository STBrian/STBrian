## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm just a person who likes to work on his personal projects from time to time. I'm currently doing MC3DS related projects, feel free to check out some of my projects, I recommend the ones in the Pinned section.

I don't know what else to put here, but while I think of something I'll put the following graphs that looks nice and are informative.
